# Mini Bank

- I created this app as a side project.
- The inspiration behind this app was to manage my expenses and explore Svelte Framework while creating someting useful.
- It aims to manage expenses for different accounts termed as wallets in the app. You can Add,Edit and delete transactions according to your expenses.
- All the data is stored in the localstorage of your browser, Making all of your data truly yours.
- You can also install the app as a PWA.
- I will be working on this part time, adding some more features like migrating storage from localstorage to IndexedDB, Adding Export and Import Options etc.
- If you are using the app and find it helpful, A ‚≠ê is appreciated. 
- Feel free to create issues if you found any while using the app.
- This app is live [here](https://mini-bank.netlify.app/)
